# Build, Publish, Document Data Models & GraphQL API's

A cloud native builder application for collaborative workflow around SSOT between developers and non-developers alike. Create, document, edit, manage, publish, populate data, test, verify and deploy GraphQL schema based data models and API's. Built for Domain Driven Design principles.

* Multirole Interfaces
Establish Single Source of Truth (SSOT), where developers and non-developers work together on master schemas.

*Visualize Your Models
Toggle between simple list views, interactive graph, form editor, SDL or JSON, while working on your data models.

* Test Your Models & API's
Auto populate your data models with a built-in data faker to test and validate your GraphQL Schema & API's with GraphiQL.
